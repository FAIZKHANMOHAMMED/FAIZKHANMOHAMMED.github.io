                1.MUMBAI INDIANS
            </big></h2><small>Mumbai Indians are a franchise cricket team based in Mumbai, Maharashtra, that competes in
            the Indian Premier League and is the most successful team of the tournament with 5 titles. Founded in 2008,
            the team is owned by India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, through its 100% subsidiary Indiawin
            Sports. Since its establishment, the team has played its home matches in the 33,108-capacity Wankhede
            Stadium in Mumbai.

            In 2017, the Mumbai Indians became the first franchise to cross the $100 million mark in brand value among
            the IPL franchises.[2] The brand value of Mumbai Indians, in 2019, is estimated to be around ₹809 crore
            (roughly $115 million), the highest among all the IPL franchises for the fourth consecutive year.[3]

            Mumbai Indians won the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 after beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by 31 runs
            in the final. The team won the double by winning its first IPL title, in 2013, by defeating Chennai Super
            Kings by 23 runs in the final, and then defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 33 runs to win its second Champions
            League Twenty20 title later that year.[4][5] They won their second IPL title on 24 May 2015 by defeating the
            Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs in the final and became the third team to win more than one IPL title. On 21
            May 2017, they won their third IPL title by defeating the Rising Pune Supergiant by 1 run in a thrilling
            final, thus becoming the first team to win three IPL titles.[6] While playing the tournament, they won their
            100th T20, becoming the first team to do so. In 2019, they repeated the same feat as they won a record
            breaking fourth IPL title, by beating CSK by just 1 run on 12 May 2019 in the IPL Final. They became the
            first team to win the IPL title for the fifth time, by beating Delhi Capitals by 5 wickets on 10 November
            2020 in the IPL Final.[7]

            Mumbai Indians are currently captained by Rohit Sharma. Mahela Jayawardene was appointed as head coach of
            Mumbai Indians before the 2017 season.[8] Sharma is the leading run scorer of the team while Lasith Malinga
            is the leading wicket taker of the team.Team history
            2008–2009: Struggle in the initial seasons
            The Indian Premier League named four players as icon players for their respective city franchises which made
            the players unavailable to play for any team other than their city team. Sachin Tendulkar was named Mumbai's
            icon player. The icon player was also entitled to earn 15% more than the next-best paid player in their
            team. At first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in February 2008, the Mumbai franchise
            bought several star international cricketers such as Sanath Jayasuriya, Harbhajan Singh, Shaun Pollock,
            Lasith Malinga and Robin Uthappa.[11] The franchise named Sachin Tendulkar as the captain of the team and
            appointed former India cricketer Lalchand Rajput as the head coach. However, Tendulkar was injured before
            the start of the 2008 season due to which Harbhajan Singh took over as the captain in the initial stage of
            the season. The team got off to a bad start in the season losing their first four games by some
            comprehensive margins. Their first match was a five-wicket defeat to the Royal Challengers Bangalore on 20
            April 2008 at the Wankhede. Their stand-in captain, Harbhajan, was suspended from the tournament for
            reportedly slapping Sreesanth during Mumbai's league match against Kings XI Punjab. After Harbhajan's
            suspension, Shaun Pollock assumed the leadership duties until Tendulkar's return on 24 May. Under Pollock's
            captaincy, Mumbai won six out of their next six games which left them needing to win two more out of the
            remaining four matches to qualify for the semi-finals. Mumbai suffered three last-over defeats in the next
            three games, including two off the last ball, before winning their last league match. They finished fifth in
            the points table with 7 wins and 7 losses, missing out on a semi-final spot by just one point.[12].</small>

            <big>2.CHENNAI SUPER KINGS</big>
        </H2><small>Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is an Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise cricket team based in Chennai,
            Tamil Nadu, India. Founded in 2008, the team plays its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in
            Chennai. The team is owned by India Cements Limited through the Chennai Super Kings Cricket Limited holding
            company. The team was suspended for two years from the IPL starting July 2015 due to the involvement of its
            owners in the 2013 IPL betting case,[1] and won the title in its comeback season of 2018. The team is
            captained by MS Dhoni and coached by Stephen Fleming. In January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn
            sports enterprise.[2]

            The Super Kings have won the IPL title four times (in 2010, 2011, 2018, and 2021), and have the highest win
            percentage of matches among all teams in the IPL (58.98%).[3] They hold the records of most appearances in
            the playoffs (eleven) and the Final (nine) of the IPL.[4]

            In addition, they have also won the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014. The brand value of the Super
            Kings in 2019 is estimated to be around ₹732 crore (roughly $104 million), making them one of the most
            valuable IPL franchises.During the first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in January
            2008, the Chennai franchise bought a number of contemporary star cricketers such as Mahendra Singh Dhoni,
            Matthew Hayden, Stephen Fleming, Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey.[8] Dhoni became the costliest
            player of the auction, as the Chennai franchise bought him for $1.5 million.[9] The franchise named Dhoni as
            the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach.[10] They played their first game on
            19 April 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at Mohali. The Super Kings won the game by 33 runs after posting 240/5
            in 20 overs, which was the highest total of the tournament, a record surpassed by themselves in 2010.[11]
            The Super Kings ended the league stage with eight wins from 14 games and finished third on the points
            table.[12] They beat the Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets in the semifinal.[13] The Super Kings faced the
            Rajasthan Royals in the final of the IPL at Mumbai. Batting first, the Super Kings scored 163/5 in 20 overs
            and lost the game by 3 wickets off the final delivery of the match.[14] They also earned a spot in the
            inaugural Champions League Twenty20 along with Rajasthan, but the tournament was canceled due to the 2008
            Mumbai attacks and the Super Kings, along with Rajasthan, received $5 million each as compensation.[15]
            Fleming, who had decided to retire from all forms of the game after the first season of the IPL, took over
            as the coach of the Super Kings team from Wessels for the next season which was to be held in South
            Africa.</small>

        <H2 id="ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE"><big>3.ROYAL CHALLENGERS Bangalore</big></H2><small>Royal Challengers
            Bangalore (often abbreviated as RCB) are a franchise cricket team based in Bengaluru, Karnataka, that plays
            in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It was founded in 2008 by United Spirits and named after the company's
            liquor brand Royal Challenge.

            The Royal Challengers have not won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016.
            The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in the IPL – 263/5 and 49 respectively.

            <ul> Franchise history</ul>
            In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the
            Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[4] The teams for the competition,
            representing 8 different cities of India, including Bangalore, were put up on auction in Mumbai on 20
            February 2008. The Bangalore franchise was purchased by Vijay Mallya, who paid US$111.6 million for it. This
            was the second highest bid for a team, next only to Reliance Industries' bid of US$111.9 million for the
            Mumbai Indians.

            At the 2009 player auction, the franchise signed up Kevin Pietersen for a record sum of US$1.55 million,
            making him the joint costliest player, along with fellow Englishman Andrew Flintoff who was signed up by the
            Chennai Super Kings for the same amount. They also traded Zaheer Khan for Robin Uthappa with the Mumbai
            Indians and also roped in local batsman Manish Pandey from them. Ahead of the tournament, which was shifted
            to South Africa due to the general elections, the Royal Challengers named Pietersen as the team captain for
            the season. Bangalore continued to struggle during the initial games of the 2009 season, winning only two of
            their first six games under the new captain. However, the team's fortunes improved after Pietersen left for
            national duty and Kumble took over the captaincy, as the team went on to win six of their remaining eight
            league games to finish third on the points table. The team qualified for the semifinal where they faced the
            Super Kings. Electing to field first, Bangalore restricted their opponents to 146 and chased down the total
            with 5 wickets in hand, thanks to 48 and 44 by Pandey and Dravid respectively. In the final against Deccan
            Chargers, the Royal Challengers bowlers, led by Kumble's 4 for 16, kept the Chargers down to 143/6. However,
            they struggled in the runchase, with only four batsmen reaching double figures, and lost the match by six
            runs in a tense finish.[citation needed]

        <H2 id="DELHI CAPITALS"><big>4.DELHI CAPITALS</big></H2><small>Delhi Capitals (formerly Delhi Daredevils) are a
            franchise cricket team based in Delhi that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The franchise is
            jointly owned by the GMR Group and the JSW Group. The team's home ground is Arun Jaitley Stadium (formerly
            Feroz Shah Kotla), located in New Delhi. The team is coached by Ricky Ponting. The Capitals appeared in
            their first IPL final in 2020 against Mumbai Indians.[1][2]

            Franchise history
            The IPL is a cricket league organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and backed by the
            International Cricket Council (ICC). The inaugural tournament was held in April–June 2008, in which BCCI
            finalised a list of eight teams who participated in the tournament. The teams represented eight different
            cities in India, including Delhi. The teams were put up for auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008, and the
            Delhi team was bought by the property development company GMR Group for US$84 million.[3]

            In March 2018, GMR sold a 50% stake in the Delhi Daredevils to JSW Sports for ₹550 crore (US$69 million).[4]

            In December 2018, the team changed its name from the Delhi Daredevils to the Delhi Capitals.[5] Speaking to
            the rationale behind changing the team's name, co-owner and chairman Parth Jindal said, "Delhi is the power
            centre of the country, it is the capital, therefore the name Delhi Capitals."[6] Co-owner Kiran Kumar
            Grandhi said, "The new name symbolizes Delhi's identity and just like the city, we are aiming to be the
            centre of all action going forward.During the inaugural edition of the IPL, the Delhi Daredevils won their
            initial two matches against the Rajasthan Royals and the Deccan Chargers. Then, after losing a match to the
            Kings XI Punjab, the team won their next two matches against the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Chennai
            Super Kings.[citation needed]

            However, the Delhi Daredevils lost in four straight matches, breaking the streak with a win against the
            Deccan Chargers.[8] After another loss against the Kings XI Punjab,[9] they recovered and won three matches
            to finish in the final four of the league.

            The Delhi Daredevils lost to eventual champions, the Rajasthan Royals, in the semi-final.[citation needed]

            2009 IPL
            Main article: Delhi Daredevils in 2009
            The Daredevils dominated for much of the 2009 IPL season under the captaincy of former Indian opener and
            Delhi-native, Gautam Gambhir, finishing at the top of the table. The likes of former Indian opener and
            triple-Centurion Sehwag and Gambhir had both developed since the prior season. They set up many large totals
            for the Daredevils, with South African power hitter and part-time keeper AB de Villiers hitting one of only
            two centuries in the 2009 IPL (the other was made by the young Indian batter Manish Pandey) at a match in
            South Africa. The bowling team, which was composed mainly of New Zealander spin pro Daniel Vettori, India
            senior spinner Amit Mishra, Pradeep Sangwan, and former India fast bowler Ashish Nehra, was bolstered by the
            off-season signing of Australian Dirk Nannes, which created a strong bowling line-up. The batting of the
            Daredevils featured Sehwag, Gambhir, power hitter Dilshan, AB de Villiers, and Manoj Tiwary. The Daredevils
            consisted of new and then uncapped players like Australia Captain Aaron Finch and Australia all-rounder
            Glenn Maxwell, who went on to become successful in T20[clarification needed] circuits.[citation

        <H2 id="RAJASTHAN ROYALS"><big>5.RAJASTHAN ROYALS</big></H2><small>Rajasthan Royals (often abbreviated as RR)
            are a franchise cricket team based in Jaipur, Rajasthan, that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL).[1]
            Founded in 2008 as one of the initial eight IPL franchises, the team is based at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium
            in Jaipur.[2][3] The Royals are known to unearth obscure, high potential talent,[4][5][6] as well as for
            their involvement in a number of controversies and scandals.[7][8][9][10]

            The team won the inaugural edition of the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne, despite being written off
            as a title contender by the media and fans. The Royals were also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League
            Twenty20 under Rahul Dravid's captaincy.[6][11]

            On 14 July 2015, the verdict reached by a panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India suspended Rajasthan
            Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years over a 2013 betting scandal, meaning they could not participate
            in both the 2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. They returned to the competition for the 2018 season.

            The team's record run-scorer is Ajinkya Rahane with 3098 runs,[12] while the leading wicket-taker is Shane
            Watson, with 67.[13]

            (IPL) in September 2007, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[14] The Rajasthan Royals were one of
            the original eight teams in the inaugural season of the IPL in 2008. Emerging Media gained ownership of the
            Jaipur-based franchise team with a bid of $67 million, making it the least expensive team in the league.[1]

            As of 2021, the franchise is owned by Manoj Badale-led Emerging Media IPL Ltd which holds a 65% stake. Key
            minority stakeholders include Lachlan Murdoch and RedBird Capital Partners.[15] There have been past
            controversies regarding the ownership of the franchise, leading to a brief expulsion of the team from the
            league in 2010.[7] The franchise made a pre-tax profit of $7.5 million in 2009.In 2010, the BCCI decided to
            expel Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals from the IPL.[17] The expulsion baffled captain Shane Warne who
            stated that he suspected that there might be some foul play and that the BCCI might possess some ulterior
            motives.[18] The Rajasthan Royals filed an appeal against the decision and the two parties went to the
            Mumbai High Court to decide.[7] The Mumbai High Court adjourned that case until 29 October 2010,[8] but it
            was revised to 15 November because they didn't want it to coincide with Diwali celebrations from 1 to 14
            November.[9]

            Ban in 2015
            In 2015, the team was banned for two years following the Lodha Committee inquiry.[10]

            Rajasthan Royals became the source of controversy when inappropriate and fictitious bids were made,
            violating BCCI norms.[23] Ranjit Barthakur and Fraser Castellino were the only two shareholders of the team,
            which was completely unknown to the BCCI at the time.[24][25] An out-of-court settlement between the two
            ensued.[citation needed] In 2015, Rajasthan Royals were banned for two years by the BCCI, with its owner Raj
            Kundra banned for life.[26]

            Team history
            2008 IPL season
            Before the start of the inaugural IPL season, many considered the Royals as possibly the weakest team in the
            IPL, giving them little chance of competing well in the tournament.[27] Evidence of the latter opinion
            seemed to be confirmed when the team lost its first match against the Delhi Daredevils in a 9 wicket
            loss.[28] The fears were confirmed that the team was likely to struggle.[29]

            In their first home game ever at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, they played against the Kings XI Punjab
            and won by 6 wickets as Shane Watson was declared the man of the match for his unbeaten 76 off 49 balls in
            what was a successful run chase. That was followed by a crucial 3 wicket win against the season favourite,
            Deccan Chargers, in Hyderabad. The victory proved to be a huge morale booster. Yusuf Pathan won the first
            man of the match award for his bowling figures of 2/20 in 4 overs and a 28-ball 61.

            The next game against the Kolkata Knight Riders was won by 45 runs where Swapnil Asnodkar received his first
            man of the match award for a fine knock of 60 off just 34 balls.

            They further managed to defeat the Chennai Super Kings in Jaipur but lost to Mumbai Indians in Navi Mumbai.
            The Royals continued to win the next five games in a row. They were the first team to book a place in the
            semi-finals with their 65 run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore and were pitted against Chennai Super
            Kings for the finals. The Royals won by 3 wickets in the final played on 1 June 2008.

            The all-rounder Shane Watson won the man of the tournament award for scoring as many as 472 runs and picking
            17 wickets. Shane Warne's captaincy and coaching were praised and well received by everyone,[30][31]
            including opposition teams.</small>

            SunRisers Hyderabad, abbr. SRH) are a franchise cricket team based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, that
            plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL).[4] The franchise is owned by Kalanithi Maran of the SUN Group and
            was founded in 2012 after the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were terminated by the IPL.[5] The team is
            currently coached by Brian Lara and captained by Aiden Markram. Their primary home ground is the Rajiv
            Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad, which has capacity of 55,000.[6]



            Franchise history
            Sunrisers Hyderabad replaced the Deccan Chargers in 2012 and debuted in 2013. The franchise was taken over
            by Sun TV Network after the Deccan Chronicle went bankrupt. The squad was announced in Chennai on 18
            December 2012. The team is owned by Sun TV Network who won the bid with ₹85.05 crore (US$11 million) per
            year for a five-year deal, a week after the Chargers were terminated due to prolonged financial issues. Sun
            TV Network Limited, which is headquartered in Chennai, is one of India's biggest television networks with 32
            TV channels and 45 FM radio stations, making it India's largest media and entertainment company.[11]

            The team jersey was unveiled on 8 March 2013, and the team anthem composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar was
            released on 12 March 2013. The logo was unveiled on 20 December 2012, along with the announcement that the
            team's management would be led by Kris Srikkanth, now replaced by veteran Muttiah Muralitharan, Tom Moody
            and V. V. S. Laxman.Sunrisers Hyderabad made their IPL debut in the 2013 season.[4] They retained 20 players
            from the Chargers, which left slots open for 13 players (eight Indian, five overseas). They filled six of
            these with Thisara Perera, Darren Sammy, Sudeep Tyagi, Nathan McCullum, Quinton de Kock and Clint McKay.
            Kumar Sangakkara captained SRH for nine matches and Cameron White was captain for the remaining seven, as
            well as the eliminator match in the playoffs.[14] In their inaugural season, the team reached the playoffs
            but were eliminated after losing against Rajasthan Royals by 4 wickets at Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi on 22
            May 2013.[15] The team played all of their home games in Hyderabad.
            For the 2015 season, SRH retained 13 players and released 11.[21] David Warner was appointed as the captain
            for this season and led the team in all matches played.[22] Muttiah Muralitharan was appointed the team's
            bowling coach as well as mentor. Sunrisers Hyderabad played their first three home games at Visakhapatnam
            and the remaining four home games at Hyderabad.[23] The team again finished 6th with seven wins and seven
            losses, failing to reach the playoffs. Warner won the first Orange Cap for SRH.[24]

            2016–2020: Maiden title and consecutive playoff appearances
            For the 2016 season, SRH retained 15 players and released nine.[25][26] After the auction, SRH traded two
            players.[27] Sunrisers Hyderabad were crowned champions after defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore in the
            final and ending the season with 11 wins and six losses. This was their maiden, and to date only, title.
            Bhuvneshwar Kumar became the first Sunrisers Hyderabad player to win the Purple Cap.
            For the 2018 season, the Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were reinstated in the league after
            serving a two-year suspension from the competition due to the involvement of their players in the 2013 IPL
            betting scandal.[31] The IPL governing council decided that a maximum of five players can be retained by
            each IPL team. SRH retained only two players and released all remaining players from the squad. The
            retention of two players meant SRH went in to the 2018 IPL auction with ₹59 crore in their auction purse and
            three right-to-match (RTM) cards. The salary deduction for every retained player from the franchise's salary
            purse was stipulated to be ₹15 crore, ₹11 crore and ₹7 crore if three players were retained; ₹12.5 crore and
            ₹8.5 crore if two players were retained; and ₹12.5 crore if only one player was retained. For retaining an
            uncapped player, salary deduction was set at ₹3 crore.[32][33] David Warner had stepped down from captaincy
            on 28 March 2018 and the BCCI announced that he will not be allowed to play in IPL 2018 following the
            Australian ball-tampering controversy.[34] On 29 March, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson was chosen to
            lead SRH for the 2018 season. On 31 March, England batsman Alex Hales was announced as replacement for the
            banned David Warner.[35][36][37] SRH finished the 2018 season as runners-up of the competition after losing
            to Chennai Super Kings in the final with 10 wins and seven losses.[38] Williamson won the Orange Cap with
            735 runs.[39]

        <small>Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are a franchise cricket team representing the city of Kolkata in the Indian
            Premier League. The franchise is owned by Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, actress Juhi Chawla and her spouse
            Jay Mehta. The Knight Riders play at the Eden Gardens stadium.[2]

            The franchise, which has gained immense popularity due to its association with celebrity owners, qualified
            for the IPL playoffs for the first time in 2011. They became the IPL champions in 2012, by defeating Chennai
            Super Kings in the final. They repeated the feat in 2014, defeating Kings XI Punjab.[3] The Knight Riders
            hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).[4]

            The side's all-time leading run-scorer is Gautam Gambhir,[5] while their leading wicket-taker is Sunil
            Narine.[6] The official theme of the team is Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo Re (we will perform, fight, and win!) and
            the official colours are purple and gold.

            Franchise history

            Khan on the right.
            In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) created the cricket tournament Indian Premier
            League, based on the Twenty20 format of the game.[7] Eight teams participated in the inaugural tournament
            held in April – June 2008. The teams representing the eight different cities of India were put up on auction
            in Mumbai on 20 February 2008. The team representing Kolkata was eventually bought by Bollywood superstar
            Shah Rukh Khan's company Red Chillies Entertainment in partnership with actress Juhi Chawla and her husband
            Jay Mehta for a price of $75.09 million, equal to approximately ₹2.98 billion at that time.[8] Sourav
            Ganguly, former captain of the Indian national team, a native of West Bengal and the current President of
            BCCI, was named the Icon player for the team. The name of the team is a reference to the popular 1980s
            American television series Knight Rider.[9]



            The tagline of the team was "All the King's Men" during the first four seasons.[16] However, in the fifth it
            was replaced by "New Dawn, New Knights". The team's official colours were black and gold during the first
            two seasons. At the time, Khan said that "golden symbolizes spirit of life and black presents the Goddess
            Kali."[16] It was later changed to purple and gold during the third season and was kept so. The jersey was
            created by Bollywood fashion designer Manish Malhotra.[16]

            The main theme of the team Korbo, Lorbo, Jeetbo Re (we will act, fight, and win!) was scored by
            Vishal–Shekhar duo.[16] A Knight Riders album featuring several singers and music composers including Usha
            Uthup and Bappi Lahiri was also created.[17][18]
            Mumbai Indians
            Both the teams play in major markets, as the Mumbai Indians play in Mumbai and the Kolkata Knight Riders
            play in Kolkata. The Mumbai Indians are the most successful IPL franchise with five championships, but until
            Mumbai's third championship, both the teams were tied with two championships. In the first two seasons of
            the IPL, Mumbai swept Kolkata in all four games. It was not until the 2010 IPL Season that Kolkata won
            against Mumbai. Both sides have been captained by Indian cricket legends at one point (Mumbai was captained
            by Sachin Tendulkar, and Kolkata was captained by Sourav Ganguly). This rivalry has often played out in
            Mumbai's favour, as they have won 22 games compared to Kolkata's nine wins. Both have played each other
            twice in the playoffs.[19]

            In 2011, both teams played against each other in the Eliminator round, as both franchises made their first
            playoff appearances. This was the first time that the two teams met in the playoffs. Mumbai won the match by
            four wickets and advanced to the next round, ultimately losing to the Royal Challengers Bangalore.

            In 2012, both the teams were chasing a playoff spot in the tournament. The game started out poorly for KKR
            as their batting side did not score runs. KKR picked up the pace and ended the innings with 140/7. Mumbai
            was expected to win at that point and started to attack quickly, and started 60/2 with more than 10 overs
            left to play. Mumbai quickly collapsed and finished their innings with 108 runs and all out. Sunil Narine
            was named Man of the Match with 4 wickets, and KKR eliminated MI from the playoffs. KKR won its first
            championship that season. Knight Riders owner Shah Rukh Khan was handed a 5-year ban at Wankhede Stadium,
            home of the Mumbai Indians. He was accused of walking on the field post-match and abusing the security
            guards.[20] In 2015, the ban was lifted.[21]

            their home games at either Dharamsala or Indore. Apart from the 2014 season when they topped the league
            table and finished runners-up, the team has made only one other playoff appearance in 13 seasons.
            Franchise history
            In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) created the cricket tournament the Indian Premier
            League, based on the Twenty20 format of the game. Franchises for eight cities were made available in an
            auction held in Mumbai on 20 February 2008. The team representing Punjab was bought by the Dabur group's
            Mohit Burman (46%), the Wadia group's Ness Wadia (23%), Preity Zinta (23%), and Saptarshi Dey of the Dey &
            Dey Group (minor stake). The group paid a total of $76 million to acquire the franchise.

            As the Kings XI Punjab, the franchise's catchment areas were the regions of Kashmir, Jammu, Himachal
            Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana—evident from the letter sequence "K J H P H" in the banner of the team's

            The 2008 tournament got off to a slow start for the Kings XI Punjab, with the team losing their first two
            games. However, 94 runs by Kumar Sangakkara helped them to win the third game. Despite the absence of Brett
            Lee and Simon Katich (who were committed to tour the West Indies with Australia), the team found its groove.
            Powered by their balanced bowling line-up[10] and effective top order,[11] the team won nine of its next 10
            matches, clinching a berth in the semi-final, where their run in the tournament came to an end with a
            comprehensive nine-wicket loss to the Chennai Super Kings.

            Main article: Kings XI Punjab in 2009
            Finishing as semi-finalists in 2008, Kings XI Punjab started with ambitions to win the trophy. These were
            supported by their new sponsors Emirates. With two available slots to fill, the Kings XI Punjab made bids on
            Jerome Taylor and Yusuf Abdulla at the second IPL auction.

            The team took a hit as most of their Australian cricketers were unavailable. The team lacked available pace
            bowlers after Jerome Taylor backed out at the last minute with an injury.

            The team lost badly to the Delhi Daredevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), however, they returned to
            form by beating the Royal Challengers, the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians. Then the team witnessed
            a roller-coaster ride in their next eight matches with four wins and four losses. The team's semi-final
            hopes were crushed after losing to the Chennai Super Kings in their last match.

            Franchise history
            The Governing Council of the Indian Premier League issued an invitation to tender for two new sides in
            August 2021.[7] A total of 22 companies declared an interest, but with a high base price for the new teams,
            there were no more than six serious bidders. The Board of Control for Cricket in India allowed a consortium
            of three companies or individuals to bid for each franchise. CVC Capital Partners, a British private equity
            and investment advisory firm, won the rights to operate the Ahmedabad franchise with a bid of ₹5,625 crore
            (US$700 million).[8][9][10]
            After drafting three players for Gujarat Titans by spending ₹38 crore, they had the remaining purse of ₹52
            crore ahead of the 2022 mega auction as the franchise is allowed to have a total purse of ₹90 crore.
            They had 22 open slots (for building a squad of 25 players) and seven of these could be overseas players.
            Team history
            2022 IPL season
            Although their auction methods and their selections during their first-ever auction were considered weak,
            and the team was written off, the Titans surprised everyone with their performances, gaining their first win
            against fellow newcomers Lucknow Super Giants. That win was the first in their inaugural campaign, which saw
            the Titans eventually win 10 of their 14 group matches, qualifying at the top of the table with 20 points.
            They then won the first qualifier against Rajasthan Royals, whom they would meet again in the final after
            their qualifier win against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Gujarat won the final by restricting Rajasthan to
            130 on a pitch on which they were asked to bowl first, and chasing down the target with 11 balls to spare,
            which included Shubman Gill hitting the winning six off the first ball of the 19th over. Hardik Pandya was
            adjudged the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 3/17 and his 34 from 30 balls with a strike rate of
            113.33. Critics have praised Pandya's captaincy, bowling, and batting, with many agreeing that he and the
            management used their players well and have worked as a team to win the tournament.

            This win meant that Gujarat became the second team to win the IPL in their very first season, the first
            being their final opponents, Rajasthan Royals. Nevertheless, Gujarat became the first team in the IPL
            against teams who already have been playing since 2008 to win the title in their very first outing. This win
            is also Hardik's 5th IPL title, and first as a captain, having won all previous four with the Mumbai
            Indians.</small>
